      <description>Background I was talking in Intern0t several months ago. AcidGen, from IOActive mentioned that he found a bug in XBMC. I use XBMC quite a bit at home, on various platforms, since it&amp;rsquo;s extremely wife-friendly. I hit him up, and we started talking. We had a nice Skype conversation, where we discussed possible platforms that were affected, and future exploits that we&amp;rsquo;d like to find. Since I had a jailbroken Apple TV 2 and RaspberryPi, I told him that I could test those platforms and help out.</description>

      <description>Finally, with level 7 of OverTheWire&amp;rsquo;s Natas wargame, we start to get to more &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; vulnerabilities. It&amp;rsquo;s still very easy, but it&amp;rsquo;s at least getting better.
We start with a single page, that has 2 navigation links.
 I noted that the URLs had a &amp;ldquo;page=&amp;rdquo; parameter. I thought maybe this would be the file it was including. Viewing the source gave a nice reminder of where the password for the next level would be stored.</description>
