&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a customer of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; for my domain name needs. However, that will be changing because I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that they take issues seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-security-issue&#34;&gt;The first security issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was browsing their site, looking for a new domain, and being the constant tinkerer I am, I entered a single quote into the textfield. I noticed an error, and eventually crafted this url:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&#34;&gt;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing magical in that URL, however it demonstrated a real vulnerability in their code:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hover_original_xss.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From that point, it could be trivial for an attacker to redirect traffic, and steal user sessions, thus being able to purchase domains with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reported this issue to them, and had an update within 3 days. They had fixed it, and that URL no longer is vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-second-security-issue&#34;&gt;The second security issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, I was discussing Cross-Site Scripting attacks with a coworker, and was talking about the finding I had with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; and how quickly they responded. Upon further investigation, I found that they didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; fix it, they just put a band-aid on it. I found the following URL was still vulnerable, but it was a little harder to exploit (onMouseOver):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=hi.com%27%20style%3d%27height:10000px%27%20onmouseover%3d%27alert%28%22xss%22%29&#34;&gt;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=hi.com%27%20style%3d%27height:10000px%27%20onmouseover%3d%27alert%28%22xss%22%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hover_second_xss.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This really depressed me, since I have spent my fair share of time being a developer, and I always tried to actually &lt;i&gt;fix&lt;/i&gt;problems, instead of just making the symptom go away. Again, I reported the issue, hoping that I&amp;rsquo;d get another quick turnaround. I asked them to reply within 30 days to indicate their intent on coordinating efforts for remediation. I waited, but I still have no response from them, and it&amp;rsquo;s been over 30 days. I still can&amp;rsquo;t believe they couldn&amp;rsquo;t even respond with a, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re working on it&amp;rdquo;, response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-billing-issue&#34;&gt;The billing issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received an email from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; about a domain name of mine expiring soon. I went into my account, and saw that the credit card was expired, so I went to update it. Unfortunately, I got this error instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declined by Fraud Service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hover_fraud.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, I figured that it was some sort of error, and tried filling it out a couple more times, verifying my card number was correct.After-all, I was only updating the expiration date, nothing else. Unfortunately, all this resulted in were several temporary one dollar charges on my credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I contacted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; and was disappointed yet again. I stated that I was trying to update my credit card details, and instead they renewed my domain for another year, and said, &amp;ldquo;it failed when you placed the order, but I was able to renew it on my end&amp;rdquo;. I was a bit upset because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet decided if I was going to renew through them or not yet, due to the previous security issues. I replied back that it still wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping me for my other domains that will need renewed at some point, and was given these instructions to help troubleshoot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use only the first and last name, no middle initial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the phone number to numbers only, no hyphens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was a bit odd, since most credit card processors want your name &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt;as it shows on the card. I complied, but it did not help. The second issue I thought was absurd because if their system didn&amp;rsquo;t allow hyphens, why didn&amp;rsquo;t they prevent the user from entering them? This is exactly what javascript validation is for. (Note that they should also validate it on the server-side as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their next steps were to have me call, and give them my credit card number over the phone, and have a billing statement ready to verify every bit of information, as if I&amp;rsquo;ve never used a credit card on a website before. It was a bit insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-0-day-security-issue&#34;&gt;The 0-day security issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had recently read an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/2010/stuffing-javascript-into-dns-names&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on inserting javascript into DNS to be used for exploitation. I was tinkering with this idea on my own domain names. Unfortunately, I ended up trying to diagnose why none of the DNS records I created in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; DNS Manager ever made it to their public DNS servers. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing they have some filtering on the back-end. Eventually I found that their DNS manager was also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hover_persistent_xss.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This time, it&amp;rsquo;s a persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Every time I navigate to my DNS management screen, I now get a dialog with my cookie. All a user had to do was add a TXT record with the following data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drupal.org/files/images/sup-dog-magnet-c117515921.jpeg&#39;&#34;&gt;https://drupal.org/files/images/sup-dog-magnet-c117515921.jpeg&#39;&lt;/a&gt; onload=&amp;lsquo;javascript:alert(document.cookie)\;&amp;rsquo;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They apparently do not even try to filter user-input at all. It&amp;rsquo;s quite depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-tl-dr-http-www-urbandictionary-com-define-php-term-tl-3bdr&#34;&gt;Conclusion (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr&#34;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; seems to suffer from the inability to filter user-input. This has become a big problem over the last few years. There are many attacks stemming from this seemingly simple attack. I did my best, and tried reporting to them, but they seem unresponsive, and even when they are, it&amp;rsquo;s not always useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be moving my domains elsewhere. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet decided where, and I have a bit of time, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel safe keeping my data stored somewhere that can&amp;rsquo;t even stop basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-T10&#34;&gt;OWASP Top 10&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities on their main page.&lt;/p&gt;
