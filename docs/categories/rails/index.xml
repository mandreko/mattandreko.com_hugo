&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-results&#34;&gt;The results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I posted previously, I was taking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-with-backtrack/&#34;&gt;PWB&lt;/a&gt; course from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com&#34;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt;. I am happy to report that I passed with flying colors (100%)! This is the best email I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advice-for-new-students&#34;&gt;Advice for new students&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course, I learned several things, including many things about myself.
* Do the PDF/Video work first. If you wait until the end, you will hate your life. It&amp;rsquo;s so droll and boring. At least if you do it as you go, it won&amp;rsquo;t be as bad.
* If you&amp;rsquo;ve never done pentest reports before, as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t, leave plenty of time. They do take a while more than you think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you&amp;rsquo;re breaking into machines, take screenshots as you go. I unfortunately captured the text on the screens as I went along, and because the report requires screenshots, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself hacking every machine a second time.
* During the course and the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s super important to take breaks. For example, after hacking all the machines in the lab, I took 1-2 weeks off of the class, to spend time with my wife.  During the exam, I worked for the first 18 hours, then slept for 4, and woke up in time to finish the last machine.  A refreshed mind is &lt;b&gt;super&lt;/b&gt; important!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super lucky.  I talked to my employer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leafsoftwaresolutions.com&#34;&gt;Leaf Software Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, who reimbursed me for the PWB class.  I was originally just doing it for the fun.  Now my work is paying for me to have fun! Next on the list for me, will be the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/&#34;&gt;CTP&lt;/a&gt; course (for the OSCE certification).  However, this probably won&amp;rsquo;t be for a bit, maybe not until next year. This is simply due to the patience of my wife, who waited on me for 3 months to finish the last course, spending every evening alone. We&amp;rsquo;re in no hurry to do that again, but eventually will.  In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few fun projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;metasploit-post-modules-such-as-iphone-enumeration&#34;&gt;Metasploit Post modules, such as iPhone enumeration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks g0tmi1k for the idea! All the phone numbers are blacked out, for the protection of my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;password-cracking-web-gui&#34;&gt;Password Cracking Web GUI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mandreko/pwcrack-webgui&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mandreko/pwcrack-webgui&lt;/a&gt;
This is a project for me to tinker more with Ruby on Rails and password cracking.  The main idea, is to take all of the leaks that I&amp;rsquo;ve been archiving for some time now, and crack them all at once, instead of running the same wordlists and rules through every one in serial. I plan on storing all all the hashes in a MongoDB database, and then I can, for example, dump all MD5 hashes that are currently uncracked, making one big super-leak. Then, once complete, it&amp;rsquo;ll update the MongoDB database.
I have tons of fun ideas on this project, but development is slow, as rails is not my primary language. It&amp;rsquo;s more of my tinker project.  Feel free to fork it if you want to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing Guard gem causes tests to fail - Solved</title>
      <link>http://test.andreko.net/2011/08/18/installing-guard-gem-causes-tests-to-fail---solved/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2011 09:14:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://test.andreko.net/2011/08/18/installing-guard-gem-causes-tests-to-fail---solved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was tinkering with a new rails application, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://relishapp.com/rspec&#34;&gt;RSpec2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cukes.info&#34;&gt;Cucumber&lt;/a&gt; for my testing. I was able to run all my tests by typing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake spec
rake cucumber
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked perfectly, but every time I&amp;rsquo;d make a change, I&amp;rsquo;d have to run both commands.  So I looked into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guard/guard&#34;&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; gem, after watching the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://railscasts.com/episodes/264-guard&#34;&gt;RailsCast&lt;/a&gt; by Ryan Bates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by adding to my gemfile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem &#39;guard-spork&#39;
gem &#39;guard-rspec&#39;
gem &#39;guard-cucumber&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to configure guard, I ran:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle
guard init rspec
guard init cucumber
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went and ran the guard executable, only to see failures in both RSpec and Cucumber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I found that my data was persisting between tests for some reason.  I had the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner&#34;&gt;database_cleaner&lt;/a&gt; gem, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why.  I eventually found a line in both /spec/spec_helper.rb and /features/support/env.rb showing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed to work correctly when I changed it to (in both places):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DatabaseCleaner.clean_with :truncation
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure why this works. Maybe the transaction method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with sqlite, but it did manage to fix me up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cucumber testing woes - spaces</title>
      <link>http://test.andreko.net/2011/08/16/cucumber-testing-woes---spaces/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 22:47:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://test.andreko.net/2011/08/16/cucumber-testing-woes---spaces/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m working along, writing my tests, and I run into an issue where my Cucumber test is failing. I go to check it out, and see why. This is what I see:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/cucumber_fail.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve slightly outlined the relevant data in yellow. I went back, and copy/pasted the data from the creation from my factories, to the expectation of text. It still gave the same error. I was dumbfounded, as I can clearly see the exact same text in my &amp;ldquo;And I should see&amp;rdquo; as well as the actual results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much googling, and several hours of tinkering, I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubygems.org/gems/launchy&#34;&gt;launchy&lt;/a&gt; gem. I simply put in my cucumber feature, &amp;ldquo;Then show me the page&amp;rdquo;. When the test ran, it saved the output from the test to a file, and launched it in my browser. Instantly, I saw my error. Sadly, I had forgotten, that in Html, if you have two or more spaces in a row, it will ignore all but the first, unless they&amp;rsquo;re non-breaking spaces. My test was failing, because I had put two spaces in-between the sentences, and the Html rendered it with only one.&lt;/p&gt;
