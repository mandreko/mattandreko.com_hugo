      <description>Challenge 09 gave me the most issues out of any other challenge so far. This may just be because I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched PHP since version 3 was just coming out. However, it is based on a dangerous function, known as preg_replace(). There are several more dangerous functions, some of which can be seen here.
The challenge starts by giving us the source code of the program we will be exploiting.</description>
