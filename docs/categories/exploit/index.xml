      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, I read the news of a new backdoor on several devices, including those made by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.belkin.com/&#34;&gt;Belkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netgear.com&#34;&gt;NetGear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linksys.com&#34;&gt;Linksys&lt;/a&gt;, and several others. A list of what seems to be affected devices can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://wikidevi.com/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAsk&amp;amp;q=%5B%5BManuf%3A%3ASerComm%5D%5D+%5B%5BGlobal+type%3A%3A~embedded*%5D%5D&amp;amp;po=%3FFCC+ID%0D%0A%3FFCC+approval+date%3DFCC+date%0D%0A%3FEstimated+date+of+release%3DEst.+release+date%0D%0A%3FEmbedded+system+type%0D%0A%3FCPU1+brand%0D%0A%3FCPU1+model%3DCPU1+mdl.%0D%0A&amp;amp;eq=yes&amp;amp;p%5Bformat%5D=broadtable&amp;amp;sort_num=&amp;amp;order_num=ASC&amp;amp;p%5Blimit%5D=500&amp;amp;p%5Boffset%5D=&amp;amp;p%5Blink%5D=all&amp;amp;p%5Bsort%5D=&amp;amp;p%5Bheaders%5D=show&amp;amp;p%5Bmainlabel%5D=&amp;amp;p%5Bintro%5D=&amp;amp;p%5Boutro%5D=&amp;amp;p%5Bsearchlabel%5D=%25E&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/elvanderb&#34;&gt;Eloi Vanderbeken&lt;/a&gt;, who posted his findings on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; made the original discovery. He also wrote a useful python proof-of-concept exploit, which allowed command injection, but I wanted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metasploit.com&#34;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt; integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing with the proof-of-concept, I realized how powerful this backdoor could be. As I&amp;rsquo;m doing penetration tests for large enterprises, I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed that I find small consumer-grade routers all the time. With this backdoor, however, I could gain leverage into certain networks, gain credentials, or all kinds of other fun. That&amp;rsquo;s where all my learning started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration-dump-module&#34;&gt;Configuration Dump Module&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first module I wrote, with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_juan_vazquez_&#34;&gt;juan-&lt;/a&gt;, was to dump the configuration of the device&amp;rsquo;s nvram. This is useful to an attacker for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It contains clear-text passwords to the device, which can often be used to login to the remote management console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case the device gets messed up from attacking it, all the configuration values can be restored at a later time from the dump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It contains passwords, sweet passwords! People re-use their passwords everywhere, and you now have valid passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention the passwords?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a demonstration of the module running. Note the wireless SSID, keys, and additional credentials being uncovered, without having to supply any credentials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;➜  ~  msfcli auxiliary/admin/misc/sercomm_dump_config RHOST=192.168.1.1 E

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just tonight, I found that in some of the refactoring we did, the credential collection actually broke, so I made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/2878&#34;&gt;pull-request&lt;/a&gt; to fix it (in case anyone wants to try it before it&amp;rsquo;s merged to trunk). The above output was using the newer code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scanner-module&#34;&gt;The Scanner Module&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can dump the nvram configuration of a device. But what good is that if you&amp;rsquo;re unable to find vulnerable devices on the network? In came module number two, the scanner, which could scan all sorts of network ranges. In the below sample, I scanned my test network for the vulnerability, and it found my device, and detected the endianness it was communicating over. You see, MIPS, unlike x86, which is always little endian, can be big or little endian, depending on the processor. Some can even be both, I&amp;rsquo;m told. However, you need to know which, to know how to communicate with the device. You can start to see how learning MIPS was going to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-journey-to-an-exploit&#34;&gt;The journey to an exploit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first two modules really didn&amp;rsquo;t take a long time to write. The scanner for example, was all of 30 minutes, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metasploit.com&#34;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt; has so many nice mix-ins, and libraries already available. The bulk of my last week and a half was spent learning MIPS, and how to generate working payloads. Let me take you on my journey&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried using the payloads in Metasploit, since they&amp;rsquo;ve recently added MIPSBE and MIPSLE (big endian and little endian respectively). However, on my testing device, none of the payloads would work. I figured that it would probably be pretty easy to compile for MIPS based devices, since people do ARM all the time with iOS and Android development. Boy was I wrong. I spent 3 days trying to get a working toolchain. I installed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://buildroot.uclibc.org/&#34;&gt;uclibc Buildroot&lt;/a&gt; toolchain, and found that it&amp;rsquo;s documentation was a bit hard to decipher for a newbie like me. I tried using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/&#34;&gt;Sourcery Codebench&lt;/a&gt;, but again was foiled, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t target the correct MIPS processors. Eventually I was reading about using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gentoo.org&#34;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; with its &amp;ldquo;crossdev&amp;rdquo; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of compiling, I had a working base image. From there, I installed crossdev per the documentation. Additionally, I had it create cross-compilers for my MIPS target. (This took several hours to figure out how to get right) In case anyone wants it, this worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# emerge crossdev
# CBUILD=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu CHOST=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu CTARGET=mips-pc-linux-uclibc USE=-nptl crossdev --target mips-pc-linux-uclibc --without-headers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing! I could build executables! I made a simple HelloWorld app, and compiled it. It then ran on my test device. I was in business. I just had to figure out how to make a new template in Metasploit, which was going to be no fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started talking with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_juan_vazquez_&#34;&gt;juan-&lt;/a&gt;, and I mentioned that my exploit module would now upload the binary payload, but would never run, giving all sorts of random errors. However, if I manually ran &amp;lsquo;msfpayload&amp;rsquo;, and uploaded the output, it would work. For some reason I had never tried this, because I do things the hard way sometimes. When we were talking, something I said apparently made him think about it. He came back, and told me he found something. Intrigued, I asked for more information, and he showed me a typo in the core libraries that he then made into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/2849/files&#34;&gt;pull-request&lt;/a&gt;. It was a simple mistake, which was probably looked over several times. The  MIPSBE payloads were being encoded with a MIPSLE encoder, which just messed up everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he merged the pull request, the skies turned blue, and a little rainbow appeared. Payloads were being generated in my module successfully, and giving me shells. Then, I realized that all the time I spent building a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gentoo.org&#34;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; crossdev environment, and installing all kinds of tools were pretty much wasted, since it was all just due to a single character typo. On the bright side, the time wasn&amp;rsquo;t really wasted, as I did learn a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about MIPS, since I was starting to read on shellcoding too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-smell-of-fresh-shells-in-the-morning&#34;&gt;The smell of fresh shells in the morning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all that time messing with MIPS and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metasploit.com&#34;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt; ruby code, I had something working, which would actually get a shell. However, as I quickly learned over this past weekend, I forgot to account for little endian devices on the exploit. I had even written code to detect the endianness on the scanner and config dump modules, but somehow on the important command injection vulnerability, had only tested on big endian. I came clean with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_juan_vazquez_&#34;&gt;juan-&lt;/a&gt;, and told him to expect yet another pull request. He was able to make a quick fix, to get the module working for the next Pro release. I then worked to put together a new pull-request to add the little endian values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my testing over several devices, however, I found that sometimes devices that would talk to me using big endian, would sometimes require little endian payloads, and vice versa. It was odd, and I can&amp;rsquo;t explain it, but they did. So I added several new targets to my exploit, for specific devices, as well as 2 generic ones. As I get ahold of additional devices (or anyone else for that matter), the code will be updated to reflect those new values. Those changes will hopefully be merged into the trunk soon, but for now, the code can be accessed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/2874&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this bug, I have exploited a NetGear WAP4410N device:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, command injection has been turned into a fully-fledged shell. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/egyp7&#34;&gt;egyp7&lt;/a&gt; says, &amp;ldquo;I love shells&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scary-part&#34;&gt;The scary part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here you&amp;rsquo;ve seen how you can take a router, and get a shell on it. However the truly scary part is that several of these devices are listening on their WAN interface! That means a remote attacker can exploit your vulnerable router, and start mapping the inside of your network. Some devices support an SSH server, which you could then connect into, and make a dynamic socks proxy, or just forward ports. You already know the username and password to the SSH server, since you dumped all the passwords before, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another attack could be to simply change the router&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers, so that when clients connect, it serves them with an evil DNS server, making all your sites go to a remote server, which then transparently steals your credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go all tin-foil hat on this, and have some real fun. However, in the long run, I accomplished my goal, and now can compromise many of those devices I see on penetration tests, which really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t belong in the enterprise, and finally have something to back it up with, other than, &amp;ldquo;it says &amp;lsquo;Home&amp;rsquo; on the box&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun exercise, and taught me a lot about MIPS. This is also now one of my more favorite contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, it sounds like there are going to be staged payloads for MIPS, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to run the big un-staged ones. As more and more vulnerabilities start popping up on these &amp;ldquo;unconventional computers&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;ll see more and more framework around exploiting them. I for one am excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you have any access to a vulnerable device, which isn&amp;rsquo;t currently a target in the exploit module, hit me up. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get more devices added, without buying 100 routers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;d like to personally thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_juan_vazquez_&#34;&gt;juan-&lt;/a&gt;. Without your help, these code contributions would have been much lower in quality, if existing at all. You rock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sysax Multi Server 6.10 SSH DoS</title>
      <link>http://test.andreko.net/2013/04/08/sysax-multi-server-6.10-ssh-dos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 08:27:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://test.andreko.net/2013/04/08/sysax-multi-server-6.10-ssh-dos/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was recently fuzzing a bunch of SSH servers, hoping to find some remote code execution in a non-mainstream server. I ended up finding no code execution in the several that I tried, but I did find one pre-auth denial of service in Syax Multi Server 6.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;try-this-at-home&#34;&gt;Try this at home!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerable version can be downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/d6js8u6i4eioa1j/sysaxserv_setup_6.10.msi&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for anyone that would like to duplicate the DoS conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-key-exchange&#34;&gt;Understanding the Key Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that during the key exchange, where the SSH client and SSH server negotiate which ciphers to use, if you messed up just a single specific byte, the server would crash. I started reading through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-7.1&#34;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt; for SSH keyexchange, and found the key exchange to be mostly ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_ssh_hex.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started playing with the byte that caused the crash, and it seemed that it was some sort of control character, or separator. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure. However, changing it would cause a crash every time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_ssh_hex2.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out any way to get remote code execution, although someone smarter than me, may be able to do it. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll settle with a DoS exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remediation&#34;&gt;Remediation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted the developers of Sysax Multi Server on March 18 2013 and April 6 2013. They were able to release a new version (6.11) which is no longer vulnerable to this bug. If you&amp;rsquo;re running Sysax Multi Server with SSH (off by default, but plenty of users on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shodanhq.com/search?q=sysax+port%3A22&#34;&gt;ShodanHQ&lt;/a&gt;), I would highly recommend updating to 6.11, available &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysax.com/download.htm#sysaxserv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the Metasploit module I wrote for this has been merged! You can view it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/225342ce8f34b1af49e498c0cc6fa92c127187e8/modules/auxiliary/dos/windows/ssh/sysax_sshd_kexchange.rb&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buffer Overflow in HexChat 2.9.4</title>
      <link>http://test.andreko.net/2013/04/06/buffer-overflow-in-hexchat-2.9.4/</link>

      <guid>http://test.andreko.net/2013/04/06/buffer-overflow-in-hexchat-2.9.4/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A buddy of mine, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/imulitia&#34;&gt;Mulitia&lt;/a&gt;, and I were talking about 0-days, and he mentioned finding one in Hex-Chat, a popular IRC client. It was super low severity, but still neat. If you entered &amp;ldquo;/server &amp;rdquo; followed by 20,000 random characters, the application died. I decided to try to make a working exploit out of this for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted HexChat, by initialling going into the #hexchat channel on irc.freenode.net and trying to find a security contact. TingPing said I could give the details specifically through him. Eventually an issue was created: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/463&#34;&gt;https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/463&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;walkthrough-of-the-exploit&#34;&gt;Walkthrough of the exploit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exploit was a little more complicated than many I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do previously. It has 3 stages, due to bad characters that can&amp;rsquo;t be entered in the payload (pretty much anything non-alpha-numeric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-offset&#34;&gt;The offset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing&amp;rsquo;s first, when developing an exploit, you need to have the offset of the buffer so you know where to put executable statements. By using the pattern_create functionality of Mona.py, I made a 25,000 line unique string, and ran it into the program while attached to a debugger.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_pc.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I then took this long pattern, and pasted it into HexChat&amp;rsquo;s textbox, after a &amp;ldquo;/server &amp;rdquo; string:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_pattern.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once I hit enter, the debugger stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access violation when writing to [00130000] - use Shift+F7/F8/F9 to pass the exception to the program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since an exception was raised, I checked the SEH window, to see if I had overwritten the SEH handler.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_seh.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I had overwritten the SEH handler with &amp;ldquo;37635236&amp;rdquo;. I then ran mona&amp;rsquo;s pattern_offset to find the offset of the string that would overwrite the SEH handler.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_po.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Based on this knowledge, I knew the offset would be somewhere around 13340 bytes in. Since this was an SEH exploit, the next step was to find an instruction that did a pop-pop-ret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pop-pop-ret&#34;&gt;Pop-Pop-Ret&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a valid pop-pop-ret instruction became a bit difficult, because I started to find out that HexChat would pretty much only use ASCII characters. Luckily, Mona.py had me covered, and can search for filtered characters:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_mona_seh.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I went through the seh.txt file that had all the addresses, and found one that I liked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0x68626463 : pop ebx # pop ebp # ret | asciiprint,ascii,lower {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [libglib-2.0-0.dll] ASLR: False, Rebase: False, SafeSEH: False, OS: False, v2.26.1.0 (C:\Program Files\HexChat\libglib-2.0-0.dll)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This string was all lowercase letters, had no ASLR or SafeSEH, so it seemed like a fairly good address to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-jump&#34;&gt;The jump&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a little test exploit stub so I could see the memory after the pop-pop-ret occurred. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really anything special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mandreko$ perl -e &#39;print &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;x13340 . &amp;quot;\x63\x64\x62\x68&amp;quot; . &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;x11656&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pasted it into HexChat, and saw the same Access Violation. I checked the SEH window to make sure I overwrote properly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_seh2.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can see there, that the SEH is now pointing to the address of the pop-pop-ret. I created a breakpoint for 0x68626463 and hit Shift-F9. I hit the breakpoint, and F7 3 times to step through the pop-pop-ret.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Typically, in an SEH exploit, right before the PPR instruction, you&amp;rsquo;d put the next instruction that you want to execute, the nseh (more details at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/28/seh-based-exploit-writing-tutorial-continued-just-another-example-part-3b/&#34;&gt;Corelan&amp;rsquo;s excellent blog&lt;/a&gt;). This instruction is typically a jump. Due to our ascii issue, I found it was possible to do a 21 byte jump, by using a conditional &amp;ldquo;JA&amp;rdquo; jump (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for jump details) instruction. I had to prepend 2 &amp;ldquo;DEC ESP&amp;rdquo; instructions to make the conditional jump work, by setting the proper flags. This left my exploit stub looking like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mandreko$ perl -e &#39;print &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;x13336 . &amp;quot;\x4c\x4c\x77\x21&amp;quot; . &amp;quot;\x63\x64\x62\x68&amp;quot; . &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;x11656&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-more-space&#34;&gt;Getting more space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the exploit stub, followed the pop-pop-ret and then the jump, and found myself in memory that I controlled. That was the good news. Unfortunately, the bad news was that I only had a very limited amount of space to put any payload (43 bytes). My first thought was to use an egghunter, however egghunters had non-ascii characters in them, and when encoded properly, were well over 43 bytes long. This left me thinking for a good while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple days of thinking, I thought about using a fairly non-traditional method to exploit this. In the stack, way down, was a pointer to the beginning of the buffer I sent into HexChat. I was able to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings&#34;&gt;POPAD instruction&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of several ESP values at once, since it&amp;rsquo;s Opcode was an ASCII character. By combining 38 POPAD instructions, I was able to get to the pointer in memory, and still have 5 bytes of memory to try to load it. My exploit-stub ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mandreko$ perl -e &#39;print &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;x13336 . &amp;quot;\x4c\x4c\x77\x21&amp;quot; . &amp;quot;\x63\x64\x62\x68&amp;quot; . &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;x29 . &amp;quot;\x61&amp;quot;x38 . &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;x11589&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ran it through the debugger, it worked out perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_after_popad.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-jump-via-corruption&#34;&gt;Finding the jump via corruption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only 5 bytes remaining, and ASCII encoding requirements, I pondered a bit. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any way to get a &amp;ldquo;JMP ESP&amp;rdquo;. I found a JMP ESP in one of the loaded libraries, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough space to push it into memory and then RETN. For some reason, during testing, I found that some of my non-ASCII characters were bad-characters, and would get translated to RETN statements. I thought perhaps I could use a &amp;ldquo;PUSH ESP&amp;rdquo; instruction which was ASCII, and then use a bad-character to convert into a &amp;ldquo;RETN&amp;rdquo; instruction, since it typically would not be ASCII (\xc3). It ended up working. I put a &amp;ldquo;\xE9&amp;rdquo;, and it converted it to &amp;ldquo;RETN&amp;rdquo; and then an &amp;ldquo;\x88&amp;rdquo;. Since I&amp;rsquo;d never be hitting the &amp;ldquo;\x88&amp;rdquo; I figured this would work. I tried it, and miraculously it did! Using a corrupted character actually let it jump!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_push_esp.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After taking the &amp;ldquo;RETN&amp;rdquo;, it placed me in an area with thousands of bytes for shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/hexchat_after_push_esp.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From this point, it was just as easy as inserting some alpha-numeric encoded shellcode, and changing some lengths of junk strings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking in &lt;a href=&#34;irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/intern0t&#34;&gt;Intern0t&lt;/a&gt; several months ago. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Acidgen&#34;&gt;AcidGen&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ioactive.com&#34;&gt;IOActive&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he found a bug in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xbmc.org&#34;&gt;XBMC&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xbmc.org&#34;&gt;XBMC&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit at home, on various platforms, since it&amp;rsquo;s extremely wife-friendly. I hit him up, and we started talking. We had a nice Skype conversation, where we discussed possible platforms that were affected, and future exploits that we&amp;rsquo;d like to find. Since I had a jailbroken &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/appletv&#34;&gt;Apple TV 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org&#34;&gt;RaspberryPi&lt;/a&gt;, I told him that I could test those platforms and help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/Security_Advisory_XBMC.pdf&#34;&gt;official disclosure&lt;/a&gt; was released, detailing the directory traversal vulnerability. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xbmc.org&#34;&gt;XBMC&lt;/a&gt; team was able to make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/bdff099c024521941cb0956fe01d99ab52a65335&#34;&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt;, and the new version 12 is not vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-this-vulnerability-matter&#34;&gt;Why does this vulnerability matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xbmc.org&#34;&gt;XBMC&lt;/a&gt;, they seemed to play off the vulnerability, because they believed nobody would ever expose this service to a public network. However, a quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shodanhq.com/search?q=xbmc&#34;&gt;ShodanHQ&lt;/a&gt; search shows that people are exposing it. But you may say, &amp;ldquo;Matt, this is only a directory traversal vulnerability, what are you going to do, steal someone&amp;rsquo;s MP3s?&amp;rdquo;. The issue here, lies in that if you can read any file on the system, that may include password files, such as /etc/passwd or even /etc/shadow if the service runs as root. What makes this even worse, is that due to how XBMC has to pass credentials to a fileserver, it stores the credentials in plain text. This gives an attacker a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; advantage. They now have valid credentials on at least one system. If the system has SMB exposed as well, it could easily be game-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-see-the-exploit&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see the exploit&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it took so long, but I finally finished the MSF module for this vulnerability. It can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/gather/xbmc_traversal.rb&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The usage is pretty simple. Here is a sample exploitation against an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/appletv&#34;&gt;Apple TV 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, watch the pretty ASCII-art go by, and use the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, run the exploit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf  auxiliary(xbmc_traversal) &amp;gt; run

[+] File saved in: /Users/mandreko/.msf4/loot/20130223100731_default_192.168.1.102_xbmc.http_604967.xml
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf  auxiliary(xbmc_traversal) &amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this was successful. It saved the file locally, and added notes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metasploit.com&#34;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt;. Just to verify the findings, you can read the file it saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf  auxiliary(xbmc_traversal) &amp;gt; cat /Users/mandreko/.msf4/loot/20130223100731_default_192.168.1.102_xbmc.http_604967.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[*] exec: cat /Users/mandreko/.msf4/loot/20130223100731_default_192.168.1.102_xbmc.http_604967.xml

&amp;lt;passwords&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;from pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://192.168.1.2/Movies&amp;lt;/from&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;to pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://xbmc:xbmc@192.168.1.2/Movies/&amp;lt;/to&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;from pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://192.168.1.2/tv&amp;lt;/from&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;to pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://xbmc:xbmc@192.168.1.2/tv/&amp;lt;/to&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;from pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://192.168.1.2/Music&amp;lt;/from&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;to pathversion=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;smb://xbmc:xbmc@192.168.1.2/Music/&amp;lt;/to&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/passwords&amp;gt;
msf  auxiliary(xbmc_traversal) &amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. You now have valid credentials on that fileserver. You could start escalating with psexec or other methods. Half the battle is already over.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sysax 5.64 HTTP Remote Buffer Overflow</title>
      <link>http://test.andreko.net/2012/07/28/sysax-5.64-http-remote-buffer-overflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2012 22:56:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://test.andreko.net/2012/07/28/sysax-5.64-http-remote-buffer-overflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have discovered a bug in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sysax.com/server/index.htm&#34;&gt;Sysax Multi-Server application&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s in the HTTP File Server service, which is not enabled by default. It has to be turned on by the admin for this exploit to properly function. The user in question also needs permission to create a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Sysax service, the configuration would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_5.64_protocols.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To trigger this vulnerability is pretty simple. Log into the HTTP File Server:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_5.64_login.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After logging in, click the &amp;ldquo;Create Folder&amp;rdquo; link:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_5.64_main.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Folder Name&amp;rdquo; textbox, enter 1000 &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;s:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_5.64_create_folder.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The service will then crash, and have the EIP address overwritten:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/sysax_5.64_crash.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I reported this vulnerability to CodeOrigin, the creators of the Sysax Multi-Server on July 26 17:24 PM EDT. Surprisingly, they got back to me at July 27 04:28 AM PDT with a new version available (5.65).  Unfortunately this version had the same vulnerability, although the EIP offset was different. After reporting this, they got back to me again at July 28 06:59 AM PDT, stating that a new version was available (5.66). This new version appears to have the vulnerability fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using Sysax Multi-Server, please upgrade, to prevent attackers from infiltrating your systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploit can now be found on exploit-db, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20676&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also download the vulnerable version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a bunch to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cd1zz&#34;&gt;@cd1zz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iMulitia&#34;&gt;@iMulitia&lt;/a&gt; for pointing me to this app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (2012-08-19): The original exploit had an issue with a variable EIP offset, due to the fact that the root folder for the user was part of the stack.  I was able to discover a second vulnerability to get the server to disclose the path.  This has been incorporated into the new exploit, and works much better.  Sysax has released an updated version that is no longer vulnerable to this.&lt;/p&gt;
