      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read a ton of articles on bypassing Antivirus software when trying to run shellcode on machines. There&amp;rsquo;s just a ton available. These are just a few examples:
 http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/wiki/Using_a_Custom_Executable_to_Bypass_AV http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Antivirus_Bypass http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bypassing-anti-virus-with-metasploit http://clshack.com/metasploit-shellcodeexec-bypassing-any-anti-virus.html http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2011/07/process-injection-outside-of-metasploit.html  I was recently working with some Windows web-servers, which had ASP.net enabled, but not any other useful language. I had recently read about PowerSyringe, so I started tinkering with making some shellcode run similarly.
I ended up finding out that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do what I was wanting to do in ASP.</description>
