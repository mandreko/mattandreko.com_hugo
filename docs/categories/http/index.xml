      <description>I recently bought a new printer at home, so my wife could print coupons without manually attaching to my office printer each time (Thanks coupons.com and all the other shady sites that require spyware-like software to print coupons, and often don&amp;rsquo;t support network printers). I ended up picking up a Canon MX922. It works awesome for her, and is connected over WiFi, so any device in the house can print to it.</description>

      <description>I have been working as a security consultant for a few months now, and one finding that is on almost every webserver I come across, is the lack of an HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) implementation. This is understandable, since HSTS is still fairly new. In fact, before starting at Accuvant, I had never heard of it either! However, since most browsers support it now, I wanted to be able to report on it.</description>
