      <description>So last night I was working on a project where I needed a specific version of a .net assembly that was installed somewhere on my system, but I could not locate it by a common search. Whenever I would open up C:\Windows\Assembly\ I could see the file and the multiple versions that I had installed. However, from that window, you can not copy the files out. All I wanted, was to copy the file to my local source branch, and include it in source control.</description>
