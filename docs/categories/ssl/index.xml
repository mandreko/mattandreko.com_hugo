      <description>SSLScan is a tool that I often use when validating SSL findings on penetration tests. I had recently seen a new version come out, with color highlighting and more fanciness, but wanted it for OSX. When I tried to compile it, I noticed that it did not support SSLv2, which is something I often screenshot, so I dived into getting it all working.
This guide will outline how to compile the newer versions of SSLScan with color highlighting, on OSX while retaining SSLv2 capabilities.</description>
