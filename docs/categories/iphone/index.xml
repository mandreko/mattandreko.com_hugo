      <description>So like many people, I wanted the new iPhone 4S. Since the wife unit is on Sprint, and I&amp;rsquo;m on AT&amp;amp;T, we started looking at plans. Sprint offers a nicer family plan and lets her upgrade to a smartphone, while letting me have the iPhone. So we decided to make the switch, and do the pre-order. I called last night to verify the ordering process, and make sure that I could still get the $200 price while not using her upgrade credit.</description>
