      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a customer of Hover for my domain name needs. However, that will be changing because I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that they take issues seriously.
The first security issue I was browsing their site, looking for a new domain, and being the constant tinkerer I am, I entered a single quote into the textfield. I noticed an error, and eventually crafted this url:
 https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
 There&amp;rsquo;s nothing magical in that URL, however it demonstrated a real vulnerability in their code:</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re on your way to church Sunday morning, or just wanting a easy meal after a long day of work. One option for food may be going to a fast food restaurant. This has been the case for my entire life. Lately however I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a trend. Fast food just isn&amp;rsquo;t fast anymore. Whenever the wife and I go see her family in Lafayette, we will stop somewhere to get breakfast as a treat.</description>

      <title>Sprint iPhone 4S pre-order fiasco</title>

      <description>So like many people, I wanted the new iPhone 4S. Since the wife unit is on Sprint, and I&amp;rsquo;m on AT&amp;amp;T, we started looking at plans. Sprint offers a nicer family plan and lets her upgrade to a smartphone, while letting me have the iPhone. So we decided to make the switch, and do the pre-order. I called last night to verify the ordering process, and make sure that I could still get the $200 price while not using her upgrade credit.</description>
