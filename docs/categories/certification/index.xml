      <description>&lt;p&gt;So previously, I had blogged about recently getting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional&#34;&gt;OSCP certified&lt;/a&gt;. I came home from my vacation to find a package from Offensive Security in my mailbox all the way from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting settled down, I opened the package and found some my certificate, wrapped in a nice folder, that I have filed away to keep forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the front:

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mattandreko.com/img/oscp_folder_front.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back of the folder had me laughing for several minutes. Throughout the entire class, you get to learn a certain phrase, &amp;ldquo;Try Harder&amp;rdquo;, quite well. The admins, the docs, and even some of the machines you attempt to break into, will all taunt you with these words. Here is the back:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mattandreko.com/img/oscp_folder_back.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lastly, inside I found my certification.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if will just file this away for safe-keeping, or frame it, as a start to one of many certifications I hope to attain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com&#34;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt; for such a fun course. I plan on doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/&#34;&gt;CTP (Cracking the Perimeter)&lt;/a&gt; next, once the wife unit gets used to seeing me on a nightly basis again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get no kickbacks or referral bonuses for sending people over, but if you enjoy security, I very much urge you to try this class.  It was extremely fun.&lt;/p&gt;
