      <description>Level 8 of the OverTheWires Natas wargame was pretty simple, as a developer, but could prove more difficult if you don&amp;rsquo;t have similar background.
It starts out with a secret password input.
 Like other levels, I looked at the source code to see what was going on in the background.
 Based on this code, you can see that it has a stored secret value, that is base64 encoded, then reversed, and then converted to a hex string.</description>
