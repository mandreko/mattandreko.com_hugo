      <title>Cucumber testing woes - spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m working along, writing my tests, and I run into an issue where my Cucumber test is failing. I go to check it out, and see why. This is what I see:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://test.andreko.net/img/cucumber_fail.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve slightly outlined the relevant data in yellow. I went back, and copy/pasted the data from the creation from my factories, to the expectation of text. It still gave the same error. I was dumbfounded, as I can clearly see the exact same text in my &amp;ldquo;And I should see&amp;rdquo; as well as the actual results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much googling, and several hours of tinkering, I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubygems.org/gems/launchy&#34;&gt;launchy&lt;/a&gt; gem. I simply put in my cucumber feature, &amp;ldquo;Then show me the page&amp;rdquo;. When the test ran, it saved the output from the test to a file, and launched it in my browser. Instantly, I saw my error. Sadly, I had forgotten, that in Html, if you have two or more spaces in a row, it will ignore all but the first, unless they&amp;rsquo;re non-breaking spaces. My test was failing, because I had put two spaces in-between the sentences, and the Html rendered it with only one.&lt;/p&gt;
