Now that we're about 1/3 through to the end of the [OverTheWire](http://www.overthewire.org) Natas wargame, I'm hoping that they start to get a little more tricky. [Level 5](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas5.shtml) unfortunately is still pretty easy.

Logins often hand out cookies, so I viewed my cookies for the site. I then used the wonderful Chrome extension, [Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edit-this-cookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg), to modify the cookie that I saw it assign, from a "0" to a "1", signifying that I was logged on.

After saving the changes to the cookie, I refreshed the page, and it showed me the next level's password.
