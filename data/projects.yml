    name: Area 31 Enrollment
    description: Custom MeteorJS enrollment application for a local career center. Reduces paperwork and manual data entry for school employees, resulting in cost savings for the school. Currently working on a 2.0 version, to address all the wonderful feedback received in version 1.0, including making it generic enough that new instances can be spun up on the fly for individual schools.

    description: NodeJS application used to view your Twitter followers, and allow mass blocking. While it sounds like an odd use-case, it's quite useful when someone trolls you by buying you over 9000 followers in a day.
